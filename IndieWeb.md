The _IndieWeb_ is a movement of independent sites that interact with each other via open standards and APIs like [[Webmention]], [[microformats]], and [[ActivityPub]].

It originated with a dissatisfaction with big social media platforms and the desire to own your content.

For a quickstart, take a look at the [IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org). If you want to build an IndieWeb site, there's this amazing guide called [indiewebify.me](https://indiewebify.me)
