The Small Web is the opposite of the [[CorporateWeb]]. It's an umbrella term for all small websites, ran by individual people out of passion, as opposed to making money, which is the goal of most sites these days.

As far as I know, the term was first coined by Parimal Satyal in his article [Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/):

> But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.

I also quite like the way [Marginalia Search](https://www.marginalia.nu/marginalia-search/about/) "defines" the Small Web:

> In recent years, something has been simmering: Some call it the "Small Internet". I hesitate to call it a movement, that would imply a level of organization and intent that it does not possess. It’s a disjointed group of like-minded people that recognize that the Internet has lost a certain je ne sais quoi, it has turned from a wild and creative space, into more of shopping mall. Where ever you go, you’re prodded to subscribe to newsletters, to like and comment, to buy stuff.

> The formulation of the problem differs from purely aesthetic ones, to ones based on political doctrine. I prefer a humanist explanation. The measure of a website should be how well it enriches the life of - and empowers the visitor, rather how well it enriches the wallet of the website owner, especially not at the expense of the visitor’s long-term interests.

The [Small Technology Foundation](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development/), a tiny and independent two-person not-for-profit based in Ireland, also have a vision for the Small Web:

|Big Web|Small Web|
|---|---|
|Trust the server|Don’t trust the server|
|Don’t trust the client|Trust the client|
|Owned by corporations|Owned by individuals|
|Call people “users”|Call people “people”|
|Servers have many users multi-tenant)|A server has one owner (single-tenant)|

They're building a bunch of tools that will empower normal (aka non-programmer) people to build their own websites and hosting their own services (like Mastodon etc.)
