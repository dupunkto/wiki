_{du}punkto_ is a small [[HackerCollective]] based in the Netherlands. It's ran by [[Axcelott]] and [[MSB]], two teenagers from the Netherlands.

The name {du}punkto is derived from the Esperanto word _dupunkto_, which means _colon_. We aim to be the beginning of something, instead of the end (the semicolon indicates the end of a statement in a lot of programming languages).

It originated as a GitHub origanisation called `libre0b11`, meant for hosting some shared projects we were collaborating on. Only later, we changed the name to {du}punkto, and moved most of our hosting needs over to a small VPS running [[FreeBSD]].

We're now slowly migrating everything from our dedicated server to cheaper shared hosting. This [[Wiki]] is the first project that has been fully moved over.
