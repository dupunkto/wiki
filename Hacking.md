_Hacking_ is the practice of exploring and understanding the inner workings of computer systems, software, or networks, with the intent of modifying or improving them.

Hacking is a widely misunderstood word. Originally it meant "To program (a computer) for pleasure or compulsively". Only later it got a second meaning: "especially, to try to defeat the security systems and gain unauthorized access to a computer."
